I hate this place.
Gucking richfolk.
I heard the Lord is going to run away.
Give me money...
I hate that guy.
Worthless town.
Worthless life.
I wish I was home. They were supposed to protect us.
I don't remember.
I'm going to wish for your health next time I see a shooting star.
Oh god, their faces...
So much blood, nothing but pain and blood...
I can't go to sleep. I don't know how to shut my eyes.
My eyes are open.
You can count on it, friend o' mine.
Raining again...
You are a dog. You will die like one too.
I'm only joking. Have a laugh with me.
Another rainy afternoon...
Fog?
The fog.
